# 🎯 {PRODUCT_NAME} Wishlist & Roadmap Tracker

> **Independent tracker** for feature requests and roadmap promises from [{PRODUCT_NAME}]({PRODUCT_URL})
>
> Maintained with ❤️ and transparency by [@{MAINTAINER}](https://github.com/{MAINTAINER})

## 📊 What is this?

A public, community-driven tracker to monitor:

- Feature requests from users
- "On our roadmap" confirmations from the {PRODUCT_NAME} team
- Features that have shipped

**This is NOT an official {PRODUCT_NAME} repository.** It's an independent effort to bring transparency to feature development.

## 🎯 Why does this exist?

During my evaluation of {PRODUCT_NAME}, I found myself discussing many feature ideas with the team. Rather than lose track of these conversations, I created this public tracker to:

1. **Stay organized** - Keep all feature discussions in one place
2. **Help others** - Let other evaluators see what's coming
3. **Support {PRODUCT_NAME}** - Free feature request management! 😊
