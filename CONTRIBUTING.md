# Contributing Guide

## 🎯 Goal

Keep this tracker accurate, fair, and useful for the community while respecting the product team.

## 📝 How to Contribute

### 1. Before Creating an Issue

**Search first!** Check if someone else already requested the feature.

If it exists:
- 👍 React to show interest
- Comment with your use case
- Add new information if you have it

### 2. Creating a New Issue

**Use the templates!** They help keep things organized:

- 🟡 **Roadmap Confirmed:** Team said it's planned
- 💡 **Feature Request:** You want something new
- 🐛 **Bug Report:** Something's broken

Be specific:
- ❌ "It should be faster"
- ✅ "Operation X takes 45s vs Competitor's 12s on my 500-line input"

### 3. What Makes a Good Issue?

**✅ Good:** Clear description, explanation of why it matters, comparison to alternatives, use case or example, screenshots/links when relevant.

**❌ Not Good:** Vague requests, complaints without context, duplicates, disrespectful language.

### 4. Quoting the Team

If the team confirmed something, include: exact quote, who said it, when (date), where (email, chat, call).

## 🏷️ Labels

| Label | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| `roadmap-confirmed` | Team explicitly said it's planned |
| `investigating` | Team said they're looking into it |
| `shipped` | Feature is live and verified |
| `stalled` | No update in 90+ days |
| `bug` | Something broken that should work |
| `nice-to-have` | Would be cool but not critical |

## 🔄 Updating Issues

### When Features Ship

## ⚖️ Code of Conduct

**Be Respectful.** This repo is for constructive feedback, transparent tracking, and community collaboration. Assume good faith — teams are doing their best, roadmaps change, and not everything will ship.
